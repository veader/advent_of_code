Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 12: JSAbacusFramework.io ---</h2><p>Santa's Accounting-Elves need help balancing the books after a recent order.  Unfortunately, their accounting software uses a peculiar storage format.  That's where you come in.</p>
<p>They have a <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> document which contains a variety of things: arrays (<code>[1,2,3]</code>), objects (<code>{"a":1, "b":2}</code>), numbers, and strings.  Your first job is to simply find all of the <em>numbers</em> throughout the document and add them together.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[1,2,3]</code> and <code>{"a":2,"b":4}</code> both have a sum of <code>6</code>.</li>
<li><code>[[[3]]]</code> and <code>{"a":{"b":4},"c":-1}</code> both have a sum of <code>3</code>.</li>
<li><code>{"a":[-1,1]}</code> and <code>[-1,{"a":1}]</code> both have a sum of <code>0</code>.</li>
<li><code>[]</code> and <code>{}</code> both have a sum of <code>0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will not <span title="Nor are you likely to be eaten by a grue... during *this* puzzle, anyway.">encounter</span> any strings containing numbers.</p>
<p>What is the <em>sum of all numbers</em> in the document?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>156366</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Uh oh - the Accounting-Elves have realized that they double-counted everything <em>red</em>.</p>
<p>Ignore any object (and all of its children) which has any property with the value <code>"red"</code>.  Do this only for objects (<code>{...}</code>), not arrays (<code>[...]</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[1,2,3]</code> still has a sum of <code>6</code>.</li>
<li><code>[1,{"c":"red","b":2},3]</code> now has a sum of <code>4</code>, because the middle object is ignored.</li>
<li><code>{"d":"red","e":[1,2,3,4],"f":5}</code> now has a sum of <code>0</code>, because the entire structure is ignored.</li>
<li><code>[1,"red",5]</code> has a sum of <code>6</code>, because <code>"red"</code> in an array has no effect.</li>
</ul>
