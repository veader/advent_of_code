Oh, hello!  Funny seeing you here.

I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you aren't going to find much down here.
There certainly aren't clues to any of the puzzles.  You do risk spoiling a few
surprises for yourself, though.  Best to play the normal way and discover
everything as it was intended, I think.  The best surprises don't even appear
in the source until you unlock them for real.

Please be careful with automated requests; I'm not Google, and I can only take
so much traffic.  Please be considerate so that everyone gets to play.

If you're curious about how Advent of Code works, it's running on some custom
Perl code. Other than a few integrations (auth, analytics, ads, social media),
I built the whole thing myself, including the design, animations, prose, and
all of the puzzles.

The puzzles probably took the longest; the easiest ones were around 45 minutes
each, but the harder ones took 2-3 hours, some even longer than that. A lot of
effort went into building this thing - I hope you're enjoying playing it as
much as I enjoyed making it for you!

If you'd like to hang out, I'm @ericwastl on Twitter.

<article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Day 17: No Such Thing as Too Much ---</h2><p>The elves bought too much eggnog again - <code>150</code> liters this time.  To fit it all into your refrigerator, you'll need to move it into smaller containers.  You take an inventory of the capacities of the available containers.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have containers of size <code>20</code>, <code>15</code>, <code>10</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>5</code> liters.  If you need to store <code>25</code> liters, there are four ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>15</code> and <code>10</code></li>
<li><code>20</code> and <code>5</code> (the first <code>5</code>)</li>
<li><code>20</code> and <code>5</code> (the second <code>5</code>)</li>
<li><code>15</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>5</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Filling all containers entirely, how many different <em>combinations of containers</em> can exactly fit all <code>150</code> liters of eggnog?</p>
</article>
<p>Your puzzle answer was <code>654</code>.</p><article class="day-desc"><h2>--- Part Two ---</h2><p>While playing with all the containers in the kitchen, another load of eggnog <span title="Apparently, Amazon ships to the North Pole now.">arrives</span>!  The shipping and receiving department is requesting as many containers as you can spare.</p>
<p>Find the minimum number of containers that can exactly fit all <code>150</code> liters of eggnog.  <em>How many different ways</em> can you fill that number of containers and still hold exactly <code>150</code> litres?</p>
<p>In the example above, the minimum number of containers was two.  There were three ways to use that many containers, and so the answer there would be <code>3</code>.</p>
