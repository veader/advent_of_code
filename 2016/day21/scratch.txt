ecabd
rotate right based on e
e at position 0 so (1 + 0) = 1 rotations
decab
* how to undo? rotate left 1

ecabd
rotate right based on c
c at position 1 so (1 + 1) = 2 rotations
bdeca
* how to undo? rotate left 2

ecabd
rotate right based on a
a at position 2 so (1 + 2) = 3 rotations
abdec
* how to undo? rotate left 3

ecabd
rotate right based on b
b at position 3 so (1 + 3) = 4 rotations
cabde
* how to undo? rotate left 4

ecabd
rotate right based on d
d at position 4 so (1 + 4 + 1) = 6 rotations
result is decab
* how to undo? rotate left 1
